Machine Learning class using Google Colab

## Tutorials (following them to learn!)
**RandomForest.jl:** Implementing a RandomForest to predict tomorrow's weather based on a year of data for the city. Used Julia, to become familiar with their wrapper libraries for Scikit-learn, and practice with DataFrames.jl. Learned about the robustness of RandomForests to noise in the data, and how feature scaling isn't required for their efficient performance (being an ensemble of Deicsion Trees)
