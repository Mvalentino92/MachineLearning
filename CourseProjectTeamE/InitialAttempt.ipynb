        "    If I were to take all the houses that have pavement, and get the average SalePrice of those homes\n",
        "    (Where remember SalePrice is our label to predict), and also do the same for houses that have gravel\n",
        "    perhaps I can order them meaningfully. If on average houses with pavement seem to have a higher SalePrice assosicated\n",
        "    with them, then I should assign Pave to a numeric value of 2 (bigger is better!), and Grvl 1.\n",
        "    Now, I know this is only looking at ONE feature and drawing conclusions about its correlation to SalePrice, but\n",
