In Ensemble.jl, update the convergence critera (in hasconverged, and getnaive)

Right now, its the square root of the sum of the fitnesses. 
The fitnesses are given by the sum of the difference for every feature sqaured.

Convergence should be changed to sum(sqrt(every_fitness))/species_size

** sqrt might be too expensive. Rethink this. Will implement for now. 

In general, pick an appropiate convergence test
